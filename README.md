- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kmschre
- 👀 I’m interested in ux/ui design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics! I'm expanding my knowledge of html,CSS and about to start attempting JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any insights you have on my projects. As I am just started out I understand my projects are baseline at best, nothing but room to grow and keep improving!
